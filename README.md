# db-miniproject-2-nosql

Overview:

In this assignment we have used MongoDB and Neo4J since it is a requirement using NoSQL Database and comparing them. The other reason we choose MongoDB and Neo4J was because we had already installed them. 
What we then did was we tried to import a 24 Gb file into our databases. 
The file contained listed over userâ€™s id and who they are following. 
We encountered that the file was to large so what we did was we had the files size reduced to 2GB which worked


1)  Import stament:

      Neo4J
               
               neo4j-admin import --node=2G.csv
     
      MongoDB
                   
               mongoimport --type csv -d twitterFollowers -c followers --headerline --drop 2G.csv

2)    Database operations:
     
      Neo4J:
      returns 1000000 users id in 7ms
      ```
      Match(n) RETURN n limit(1000000)
      ```
      MongoDb
      returns 1000000 users id in 55ms
      ```
      DBQuery.shellBatchSize = 1000000
      db.followers.find()
      ```
